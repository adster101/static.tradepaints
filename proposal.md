# Preamble

When we originally started talking about this we agreed to a 'phased' approach. I still think this is a sensible way forward. Arguably, we could say phase I is complete aside from the ongoing data sync issues. As and when the data sync becomes available the 'my account' section could be launched relatively quickly after a short period of testing.

While we wait on the data sync I'm going to suggest that we agree two further phases of development. A phase II dealing with the public facing website and associated design 'refresh' and a phase III integrating a full blown shopping cart and checkout.

We could develop the shop based on data snapshots but I still think separating out the work into two more phases is likely a more manageable and sensible approach.

## Phase II

We have discussed the need for the existing site to be re-focused and updated. The current 'design' has worked reasonably well over the last few years but is starting to look a little dated. Additionally, the focus of the site should shift from what is effectively a brochure site to a more B2C style commerce site.

So, phase II will take into account the following aspects:

  - New site 'design' - 2 days
  - Update the site look and feel
    - Simplify as much as possible
  - Performance - 1-2 days
    - Optimise the site so it loads and displays quickly in accordance to current best practices
  - Change focus of site so we can incorporate a shop - 3 days
    - Review header and navigation
    - Implement a 'utility' navigation to include basket, login, branch finder, contact etc
    - Review top level navigation with a view to removing some links
  - Review industry relevant sites in order to see what new pages we need to add. - 2 days
    - Checkout flows, layout patterns, terminology, product categories etc
  - Migrate the site to use an SSL certificate. - 1 day
    - Currently the 'web' is moving towards full encryption via 'https' or ssl certificates.
    - This is required in order to process payments etc

## Phase II 'deliverables'

For this phase I will deliver the following:

- A static html website (i.e. not data driven) overlayed with a new design for Trade Paints. This will include all new pages that are required for the online shop.
- For example, product listing page, shopping cart, privacy policy
- A sitemap outlining the structure of the shop and highlighting where pages may be culled or moved
- A new joomla template for tradepaints.eu incorporating the new design.
  - This will 'prime' the site in readiness for the phase III which will be implementing the shop (mainly a series of Joomla components).
- Tradepaints.eu running under 'https'

The advantage of producing a static site is that we can iterate ideas and designs quickly with relatively little effort. In combination with researching competitor sites and various best practices we should be able to come up with a very good preview of how the revised site including the selling aspect will look.

The other advantage is that we can share this static site with the wider business get feedback and incorporate that into the design before we get bogged down with the actual build.

Lastly, once phase II has been completed we can use the static site to better estimate and spec out the work required for phase III as we have an effective blueprint to work from.
Phase II 'costings'

I'm estimating 12.5 days work @ £175/day thus £2187.5

This estimate is based on similar recent work undertaken for londoncalling.com where work of a similar nature was completed. This estimate doesn't include any 'bespoke' design work. Should third party design agencies be required these costings may need to be revised.
Phase II 'timescales'

Starting early October but looking to complete the lions share of the work the second half of October and through November aiming to put any changes live as and when they're ready.
Phase III

At this point we will have an updated website ready and primed to be integrated with real data. Again, this assumes that the fables 'data sync' will be available at some point in the future.

Working from the static site the initial work here would be to identify the various components and modifications required to incorporate the shop.

I'm not going to quote costs and time scales at this point as it wouldn't be so accurate. If you need a clearer idea of costs and timescales for this phase in order to proceed with phase II let me know and I'll put something down.
